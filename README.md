# GoogleSheets_Dynamic_Invoice
I changed the way other teachers invoiced this school forever. 
Teachers were manually tracking the number of classes with each student, entering their charges and doing their own calculations. According to one of the managers this lead to many errors and a lot of time spent corresponding with the teachers to correct invoice errors. 
I automated this process in google sheets by first creating a second worksheeet which acts as the student database. The new database contains student names, dates of class, and the status. The status column is a dropdown list with a variety of options for teachers to include. 
I then used a number of different formulaas in the invoice sheet to automatically update the invoice based upon the information entered into the cells in the student database. On the invoice all fields are dynamically filled without having to manually enter any information. 
At the end of the month, the teacher now only has to download a pdf version and email it to the school. 
There are now 36 very happy teachers.
